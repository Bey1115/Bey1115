Hi, I'm Bea 👋

Data Engineer | Data Scientist | Statistician

I work with data end-to-end, from ingestion and transformation to analysis and modeling. I enjoy building reliable data pipelines, writing efficient SQL, and turning messy datasets into meaningful insights.

What I work with:
> SQL & Python for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis
> ETL / ELT pipelines and data workflows
> Data analytics, statistical modeling, and exploratory analysis
> Data quality checks, transformations, and reporting

Currently focused on:
> Improving data pipeline reliability and performance
> Learning modern data stacks and best practices
> Strengthening statistical thinking for real-world data problems

I’m always curious about how data can support better decisions, especially in analytics-driven and real-world applications.
